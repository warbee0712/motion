# Quick Start

Let's **get started** quick by **installing** the **package** and adding the **plugin**.

From your **terminal**:

```bash
yarn add @vueuse/motion
```

In your **Vue** app **entry** file:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue-demi'
import { MotionPlugin } from '@vueuse/motion'
import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(MotionPlugin)

app.mount('#app')
```

You can now **animate** any of your **component**, **HTML** or **SVG** elements using `v-motion`.

```vue
<template>
<div
  v-motion="'smoothestDiv'"
  :initial="{
    opacity: 0,
    y: 100,
  }"
  :enter="{
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
  }"
/>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useMotions } from '@vueuse/motion'

// Get access to motion controls using useMotions
const { smoothestDiv } = useMotions()

// From smoothest div to biggest div real quick ðŸ˜Ž
smoothestDiv.apply({ scale: 4 })
</script>
```

If you want to know more about what **properties** you can **animate**, consider taking a look at [**Motion Properties**](/motion-properties).

If you want to know more about how to **create** your own **animations** styles, consider taking a look at [**Transition Properties**](/transition-properties).

If you want to know more about what are **variants** and how you can **use** them, consider taking a look at [**Variants**](/variants).

If you want to know more about how to **control** your declared **variants**, consider taking a look at [**Motion Controls**](/motion-controls).
