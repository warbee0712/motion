# Installation

Install `@vueuse/motion` using your package manager of choice.

```bash
pnpm add @vueuse/motion
```

Please note that if you are using **Vue 2** or **Nuxt**, you need to install the [**Composition API**](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html).

The **required** packages can be found [**here for Vue 2**](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api), and [**here for Nuxt**](https://composition-api.nuxtjs.org/).

## Plugin Installation

If you are planning on using the directives (`v-motion`) from this package, you might want to add the plugin to your Vue instance.

### Global Installation

You can add the support for `v-motion` globally, by installing the plugin.

```javascript
import { MotionPlugin } from '@vueuse/motion'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(MotionPlugin)

app.mount('#app')
```

### Component Installation

If you want to import the directive code only from components that uses it, import the directive and install it at component level.

```javascript
import { directive as motion } from '@vueuse/motion'

export default {
  directives: {
    motion: motion(),
  },
}
```

## Nuxt Module

If you are using [**Nuxt**](https://nuxtjs.org/), this package has a specific implementation that makes the declaration of custom directives even easier.

It is called [**nuxt-use-motion**](https://github.com/Tahul/nuxt-use-motion).

You **must** have [**@nuxtjs/composition-api**](https://composition-api.nuxtjs.org/) setup in your project in order to make this work.

Once you installed it, just add `nuxt-use-motion` to your project:

```bash
pnpm add nuxt-use-motion
```

Add `nuxt-use-motion` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.js`:

```javascript
{
  // nuxt.config.js
  modules: ['nuxt-use-motion']
}
```

Then, configure your animations ðŸ¤¹:

```javascript
{
  // nuxt.config.js
  motions: {
    directives: {
      'pop-bottom': {
        initial: {
          scale: 0,
          opacity: 0,
          y: 100
        },
        visible: {
          scale: 1,
          opacity: 1,
          y: 0
        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Vite SSG

You are concerned if you are using **frameworks** based on [Vite SSG](https://github.com/antfu/vite-ssg), such as [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) or [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).

If you are using directives within these frameworks, an error might occur during build, saying directives does not support transform.

To solve that problem, you have to install this package inside your app.

```bash
pnpm add -D patch-vue-directive-ssr
```

This [**patch**](https://github.com/vueuse/patch-vue-directive-ssr) has been written by [**Antfu**](https://github.com/antfu).
