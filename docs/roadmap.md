# Roadmap

This package is under **active development**, as it still **misses** some **features**.

As I think it is still more than **usable** in its current **state**, I'm **releasing** it.

The roadmap includes:

- **Finishing to document the whole API**
- **Finishing to write the test suite for each composable**
- **Better orchestration features**
- **Context-aware elements, to enable animations between childrens**
- **More event default variants**
- **Making a playground to create animations with ease**
